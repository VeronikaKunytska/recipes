Ingredients
3 eggs , yolks and whites separated
1/2 cup caster sugar (known as super fine / baker's sugar in the US)
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
8 oz / 250g mascarpone 
1 1/4 cups hot espresso coffee - strong! (Note 1)
2 tbsp (or more!) of liquor of choice - I like Frangelico and Kahlua
6.5 oz / 200g (24 - 30) lady fingers , pavesini or savoiardi biscuits 
Cocoa , for dusting

Instructions
Beat yolks and sugar in stand mixer on medium high for 12 minutes or until white and thick. (Note 3)
Add vanilla and mascarpone, beat until just combined. Transfer mixture to a bowl, set aside.
Clean bowl and whisk. Beat egg whites until stiff.
Fold 1/3 of the yolk mixture into the egg whites. Then gradually fold the remaining yolk mixture in and mix until just combined. 
Mix coffee and liquor together. Quickly dip biscuits in and line the bottom of a 8‚Äù/20cm square dish. (See video to see how I arrange them).
Spread over half the cream, then top with another layer of coffee dipped biscuits.
Spread with remaining cream.
Cover, refrigerate for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight
Dust with cocoa powder just before serving - either before you cut or after placing onto serving plates.
